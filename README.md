# Travelling-salesman-problem
The salesman needs to visit all houses only once!
The program will determine all the possible traveling routes starting from the first house, reaching all houses and getting back to the start.
The program will read the number of houses and the street relationship bewtween them.
It will write the results in rows, each one being a diferent but equally valid route.
